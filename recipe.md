#CHOCOLATE BISCUIT CAKE – 5 INGREDIENT

**One of our childhood favourites!**
We have fond memories at a cousin’s wedding hiding under the table scoffing our faces with chocolate biscuit cake! 
This is an wonderfully indulgent cake which always satisfies the most chocolatey of itches! 
This is a simple recipe and to most it is a total crowd pleaser!

###INGREDIENTS
 

275 g Dark chocolate
200 g Rich tea or digestive biscuits vegan
100 g coconut oil
100 g maple syrup
60 g of mixed nuts and dried fruit we used 30g walnuts 30g goji berries

###INSTRUCTIONS
 

Put the dark chocolate in a bain-marie or water bath together with the coconut oil and melt. Once melted, remove from the heat, add the maple syrup in and mix well. Leave this bowl on the bain marie to keep it liquid.
Break up the biscuits into small pieces
Line a 2lb loaf tin with baking parchment and transfer the broken biscuits
Roughly chop the walnuts into small bite sized pieces and add to the cookies in the tin along with any dried fruit. Pour the chocolate over them and spread so that all the cookies are covered.
Leave to cool to set fully and for quickest results, put in the freezer but the fridge also works well.
_Enjoy!_
